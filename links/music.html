          <p style="color:red; backgound-color: green;">I'm going to remake this section into a page about the vinyls I actually own, I think it'd be more fun to talk about the things I can hold in my hands. I got a bit of a collection so I have plenty to write about.</p>

            <p>This is my favourite record of all time. The band does such an incredible job at managing tempo and drawing out emotion without the need for words.
            Speaking of, Isaac's vocals protray this crushing dispair with lyrics of one-way romance. The consistent analogy of a 'concorde' is so evocative.
            However it is far from the only bit of imagry he uses, between bread, worms and billie eilish, it's filled with analogies and mental imagry that so prefectly convey the crushing pain.</p>

            <p>I feel like I have a lot to say about this one, but I'm struggling with how to say it. It took me a while to fall in love with their music, but something kept pulling me back.
            the building and release of tension pulls you along through these valleys of emotion, filled with tears and desire.</p>
