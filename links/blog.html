          <p>I ended up sleeping all day yesterday. A friend kept me up until 2. I woke up at 8 after that and just turned around and slept untill 23.</p>
          <p>When I got up I saw some friends in a VC and decided to join, it was late so they didn't stick around for long but it was nice. I really like my friends and they mean a lot to me, even if it doesn't seem like it all the time.</p>
          <p>I spent a few hours playing factorio, which was nice, I'm finally getting back into it now. I get the new DLC as well so there's always the pressure to play it haha.</p>
          <p>I've been fixing this site for... i don't even know how long now. Deciding to make this blog more of a diary than anything, call it virtual therapy or something. I have a lot of friends and I'm thankful for them but I wish I could have more people to talk to, I just feel like I have a lot I want to share with everyone but nobody ever seems to care enough. It's not their fault tho, they care plenty but it just doesn't feel like it to me. It's most likely just in my head but it still waeres on me, did I spell that word right? "waers" feels wrong.</p>
          <p>I think today will be a good day, I need to clean some but it feels ok so far</p>

          <p>I just spent the last 1h 20min trying to change foldmethod in neovim from manual to expr and I ended up having to re-install the entire thing, kill me...</p>
